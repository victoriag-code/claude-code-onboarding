\f0\fs24 \cf0 I would like to create a self-serve wizard that walks enterprise customers through getting started with Claude Code immediately by themselves, without any assistance from Anthropic personnel.  I have already created a UX prototype that is a good start, located in v3claude-code-wizard.html. I would like to refine it and productionize it, as follows:\
\
- The goal of the wizard is to help the user get started with Claude Code immediately, while at the same time recording information from them, which should then be sent it to a catch-all email address after the wizard is completed.\
- The language of the app should be updated to be appropriate for someone in enterprise who is looking to get Claude Code set up for his or her team. Assume that this audience is barely technical, and include copious amounts of helper tool tips for them that are appropriately placed, in order to understand any jargon or concepts (like API first party vs third party, etc)\
- After this step, it should be explained to the user that there are 2 ways to use Claude Code - one by purchasing a license per user ($200/month, and which includes Claude For Enterprise as well) and the other by using an API token. If they indicate interest in the license, it must be explained to them that they MUST get started with an API token first, but that because they indicated interest, a salesperson will reach out to them shortly after they get started\
- This whole system should be productionized, using vanilla HTML/JS/CSS for the frontend, and Node.js for the backend.\
- After implementing this, produce a Markdown file explaining what technical steps need to be taken in order to make this live. I will then take this Markdown file and determine who I need to reach out to within Anthropic in order to make this wizard a reality.}
